# Team votes
To ensure that members of a team are in agreement regarding a topic under their purview, a vote may be called by any member of the team or by a member of the Steering Council.  
The votes take the form of Discord polls, sent to one of the following channels:
- `#project-talk` for votes concerning all teams of the Project;
- `#maintenance-talk` for votes concerning the Maintainers team;
- `#internal-private` for votes that need to be held privately or concerning internal team structures;
- `#moderation-private` for votes concerning the Moderators team.

Any accompanying contextual information must be sent in messages next to the poll, alongside a ping of the role of the team in question. It is recommended that contextual information is sent directly below the poll, to increase discoverability.  
Any further discussion regarding the vote should be, to the greatest extent possible, contained in a dedicated thread.

Voting takes place in the 24 hours following the creation of the poll. Votes that are not time-sensitive may have a longer voting period, but it may not exceed one week.

For a decision to be taken by vote, a *simple* majority of the votes cast is required - that is, strictly more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the final decision.
- As an exception to the rule above, votes that seek to overrule a previous decision require a *qualified* majority - i.e., at least two thirds of the votes cast have to be in favour.

In cases involving polls with 3 or more options, if no option meets the requirements set above, the two choices with the most votes will be put to a run-off vote. If the 2nd place is tied, all of the tied choices will participate in the run-off, and if the run-off vote has the same outcome, the vote will be considered **failed**.

A vote that ends in a tie (i.e., the cast votes have been *perfectly* distributed to each option) or one in which no option has met the majority requirement is considered **failed**. In this case, the status quo will be preserved. Failed votes may be re-attempted after 30 days.

Decisions made by vote cannot be revisited after less than 90 days from their vote.
